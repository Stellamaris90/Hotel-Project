Logistic Regression Model gives its accuracy as 79%, Random Forest gives it own
accuracy as 87%, and Decision Tree gives its accruacy as 80% . Then, from the model the
Random Forest is the best for this prediction because it gave the best high accurate result which
is 87%. This also prove that random forest is best for working with a large datasets.
